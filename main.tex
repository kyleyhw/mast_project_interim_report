\section{Introduction}
% As the simplest atom, hydrogen is of significant importance to 21st century astrophysicists. 

% cosmic Dark Ages, the Cosmic Dawn, and the Epoch of Reionization -- a

 % during which the first stars are born

As the most abundant element in the Universe, mapping the distribution of atomic hydrogen has the ability to inform the processes of structure formation, as well as shed light on the processes and events which occurred during the period spanning between 375,000 years and 1 billion years after the big bang \cite{Pritchard_2012}. Conveniently, hydrogen occasionally interacts with photons of wavelength 21cm, allowing 21cm cosmologists to measure its density.

% Conveniently, hydrogen occasionally emits photons, which can be measured from Earth. This emission is produced by a spin-flip transition -- if the atom first starts with its proton's spin and electron's spin aligned, the electron sometimes spontaneously flips so that its spin is anti-aligned with the protons. This results in a photon of wavelength 21cm, and hence the aptly named field of 21cm cosmology.

% Combined with physical data such as those taken by the HERA, CHIME, and REACH, the simulations have the power to place constraints on viable theories.

The 21cm signal is of such importance that numerous simulations have been written to predict its signal. One such simulation, \code{21cmSPACE}\footnote{This name, which stands for 21-cm Semi-numerical Predictions Across Cosmic Epochs, was not given until mid-2023; older papers referring to this code do not include this name.}, has been developed by the Cambridge Cosmic Dawn group \cite{Fialkov_2014}\cite{Visbal_2012}. At the basic level, \code{21cmSPACE} takes initial conditions and evolves them through time to provide the present-day predicted 21cm global signal and 21cm power spectrum, among other astrophysical observables. This is calculated through the following method \cite{gessey-jones_2024}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A spatial volume is divided into cubical voxels of a specific side length.

    \item Large-scale fields such as the Lyman-Werner field are initialized at the first time step from initial conditions, or computed from the previous time step.

    \item These large-scale fields are used by sub-grid models within each voxel to calculate local properties, such as star formation prescription.

    \item The local properties are then used to inform the large-scale fields, propagated by non-local processes such as radiative transfer.

    \item Steps 2-4 are iterated until termination.
\end{enumerate}

% At present, the evolution timesteps of \code{21cmSPACE} is hard-coded between simulations. Operating in redshift space, the simulation begins at $z = 50$, at which point the Universe is described by linear perturbation theory with negligible halo and star formation. This permits the use of the \code{CAMB} and \code{Recfast} codes for the creation of initial conditions. The redshift then decreases by integer amounts until $z = 15$, at which point the timestep refines to a resolution of $\Delta z = 0.1$, decreasing until the simulation terminates at $z = 6$. 

Temporally, \code{21cmSPACE} operates in redshift space with hard-coded endpoints, evolving from $z = 50$ to $z = 6$. Across these redshifts, the Universe is described by linear perturbation theory. At $z = 50$, there is also negligible halo and star formation, permitting the use of the \code{CAMB}\footnote{The Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background is a code for calculating various cosmological quantities, including power spectra and transfer functions.} and \code{Recfast}\footnote{Recfast provides fast approximations for calculations of observables resulting from processes during the Epoch of Recombination, the era immediately preceding the period informed by 21cm astronomy.} codes for the creation of initial conditions \cite{gessey-jones_2024}.

Spatially, the total size of \code{21cmSPACE} can be set to one of $384^3 \text{ cMpc}^3$, $768^3 \text{ cMpc}^3$, and $1536^3 \text{ cMpc}^3$ by changing the number of $3 \text{ cMpc}$ side-length voxels to $128^3$, $256^3$, and $512^3$ respectively \cite{dhandha_2022}. This largest simulation size of $1536^3 \text{ cMpc}^3$ allows \code{21cmSPACE} to be useful in the forecasting for the SKA \footnote{The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) experiment is a next generation 21cm project which expects to detect first light in 2027.}, whose beam covers a large enough square-angle at high redshifts to require this volume. The voxel side-length itself, however, is currently hard-coded, which is disadvantageous since requiring $512^3$ voxels to simulate a $1536^3 \text{ cMpc}^3$ box causes a single execution to cost upwards of 23000 CPU hours. Therefore, although it is possible to use \code{21cmSPACE} to forecast for experiments such as the SKA, the large number of simulations needed to adequately explore the parameter space of initial conditions renders the package nonviable in practice.

 % On Cambridge's Wilkes3 HPC cluster, this costs hundreds of GBP, takes approximately 2 weeks to complete, and contributes $175 \text{ gCO}_2\text{eq}$ of greenhouse gases \cite{dhandha_2022}.

Additionally, the initial conditions are currently calculated from fixed parameters. In particular, \code{21cmSPACE} assumes the Planck 2015 best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model as a fixed cosmology \cite{Planck_2016}. The initial overdensity field $\delta_m$ and baryon-dark matter relative velocity $v_{bc}$ are computed \cite{Fialkov_2012} from the matter power spectrum and velocity power spectrum as output from \code{CAMB}, and the initial gas temperature and ionization fraction are calculated from the outputs provided by \code{Recfast}, both assuming Planck 2015.

\section{Project Objectives}

The goals of this research project are twofold: 1. to allow the variation of voxel size in the spatial division of the simulation, as well as 2. to allow implementation of cosmologies other than Planck 2015 in the initialization of starting values. 

Success in the first objective will enable \code{21cmSPACE} to simulate large spatial volumes with fewer voxels,drastically decreasing runtime and enabling \code{21cmSPACE} to be used for SKA forecasting. Of course, changing the voxel size can alter the final result of the simulation; this will therefore need to be rigorously tested as part of the project to ensure that accuracy in the observables is unaffected. 

Achieving the second objective will create a pipeline from a given cosmology to a predicted 21cm signal. Hence, if the predicted signal does not fall within the errors for current experimental data, the cosmology can be rejected. In other words, by making possible the variation of cosmology, \code{21cmSPACE} can be used to verify or reject theories.

\section{Project progress}


% The initial conditions of \code{21cmSPACE} at $z = 50$ are derived from four quantities: the matter power spectrum and velocity power spectrum as generated by  \code{CAMB}, and the hydrogen ionization history and matter temperature history as generated by \code{Recfast}. 

% These power spectra and histories must then be used to calculate a series of precomputed grids for input into the initialization of \code{21cmSPACE}. These precomputed grids contain, for each cell, the following four quantities: the matter overdensity $\delta m$, the baryon-dark matter relative velocity $v_{bc}$, the matter temperature, and the ionization fraction. It is these precomputed grids that feed directly into \code{21cmSPACE} for initialization.

% The process then consists of two macroscopic steps: the cosmological inputs to \code{CAMB} and \code{Recfast} are first changed, which alters the outputs of these codes; these outputs must then be made compatible with the inputs of \code{21cmSPACE} such that \code{21cmSPACE} can be executed using the specified cosmology. 

Progress has primarily been focused on achieving the second objective. As of now, code has been developed to alter the cosmological inputs to \code{CAMB} and \code{Recfast}, making it convenient to recalculate initial conditions. The interactions between functions are properly object-oriented such that new cosmologies can be defined simply by creating an instance of the \code{cosmology} class, which takes the following parameters at their present-day values as  as initialization variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Hubble parameter $H_0$

    \item baryonic matter density $\Omega_{\text{b},0}$

    \item dark matter density $\Omega_{\text{dm},0}$

    \item effective curvature density $\Omega_{\text{k},0}$

     \item CMB temperature $T_{\text{cmb}, 0}$.
\end{itemize}

This class is primarily organizational, written with both the intention of emulating a subset of the attributes attached to \code{Astropy} pre-defined cosmologies of datatype \code{FlatLambdaCDM} class, as well as being compatible with code written for changing \code{CAMB} and \code{Recfast} parameters. Changing these cosmologies results in altered initial conditions for \code{CAMB} outputs, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:camb_output_plots}. In particular, voxel side-lengths of $3 \text{ cMpc}$ correspond to $k$ of order $10^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ with larger side-lengths, as is one aim of this project, corresponding to smaller $k$ values where the differences induced by varied cosmologies are even more significant. On the other hand, varied cosmology has no effect on the ionization fraction nor the matter temperature, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:recfast_output_plots}. 

Taking the \code{CAMB} power spectra, \code{21cmSPACE} can be used to generate the Gaussian random fields for initialization. Taking slices of the 3D boxes allows visualization of these fields as in Fig. \ref{fig:initial_condition_grid}.

\section{Upcoming work}

Having invested time learning the usage of \code{CAMB} and \code{Recfast} for generating initial conditions, actual implementation of the initial conditions into the \code{21cmSPACE} MATLAB code by making \code{CAMB} and \code{Recfast} outputs compatible with \code{21cmSPACE} inputs may now follow naturally. The code will also have to be carefully examined to ensure that the effects of variable cosmology are correctly propagated, such as in the calculations of halo abundance. This will ideally be completed by early Lent term.

As well as this, implementation of variable voxel size will be the next step, followed by rigorous testing of the effects these changes have on the predicted signal. Ideally, this will be completed about halfway through Lent term, leaving ample time for writing up.

Finally, if time permits, the viability of upscaling these lower-resolution simulations through diffusion models can be explored, possibly recovering the same detail in the final signal at a fraction of the computational cost.
